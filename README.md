# Project structure
## Presentation : 
We put both data : train.csv and test.csv so that you can have them in the same folder to run the code. 
## Data analysis : 
dataAnalysis.py : process data for model by splitting the classes, delete missing values, and multiply features depending on the threshold. 
## Methods : 
implementations.py  : the implementation of 6 methods to train the model. 

cross_valisation.py : use cross-validation to find the best parameters for ridge regression. 

Folder Mains        : for each method, you can found a jupyter notebook file that output the prediction for both train and test data. To run this, please download this and place them in the same folder that the data and implementations.py
## Best model : 
run.py   : Results using the best model ( Regularized Logistic Regression ) for both train and test 

## Report
report.pdf: a 2-pages report of the complete solution.
